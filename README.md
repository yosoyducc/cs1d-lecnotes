# cs1d-lecnotes
Lecture notes from in-class. I'll try to update these as soon as
a given lecture is over by the end of the day.

## Notice
All rights are reserved by Med. You must not share these notes outside of class
or use this code in any software you write. This should be used
only for purposes of reference. This repository will be taken down at the
end of the semester.
